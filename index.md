## About Me

I have a love for problem solving. I was first exposed to computer science during my bachelors of civil engineering and decided to pursue this newfound interest after graduating. 

I learned the basics of web development and MVC frameworks at a bootcamp course called Bitmaker labs where I developed several Ruby on Rails applications from the ground up. Since then I've gained a couple years worth of work experience as a developer in the GTA using mainly Javascript frameworks.

I enjoy using plain text languages like Ruby and Python. In my spare time, I'm currently working on projects using the Python frameworks Django and Flask. I'm now seeking the opportunity to gain more work experience using these tools.

I always enjoy the challenge of solving a problem using new technology; drawing upon my experience to learn new tools and adapt quickly.
