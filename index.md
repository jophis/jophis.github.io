## About Me

I have a love of problem solving. I was first exposed to computer science during my bachelors of civil engineering and decided to pursue this newfound interest after graduating. 

My professional development began at a bootcamp course called Bitmaker Labs where I learned the basics of web development, databases and MVC frameworks while developing multiple Ruby on Rails applications from the ground up. In my recent work as a full stack developer in the GTA I've spent the majority of my time employing Javascript frameworks along with SQL and proprietary database technologies.

I enjoy using plain text languages like Ruby and Python. In my spare time, I'm currently working on projects using the Python frameworks Django and Flask. I'm now seeking the opportunity to gain more work experience using these tools.

I always enjoy the challenge of solving a problem using new technology; drawing upon my experience to learn new tools and adapt quickly.
